                    <p>
                      Ageing, chronic sun exposure, or acne can make your skin
                      dull, wrinkled, spotted and scarred. A chemical peel is
                      one of the most effective ways to improve the skin. It is
                      a procedure of chemical skin resurfacing by applying a
                      solution with active agents that exfoliate the top layers
                      of the skin. The new skin that grows after healing is
                      smoother, fresh, spot free and younger looking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Chemical peels are used to treat wrinkles, skin
                      discolouration and scars. Although chemical peels are used
                      mostly on the face, they can also be used to improve the
                      skin on your neck and hands. A chemical peel can be done
                      alone or in combination with other cosmetic procedures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The results of chemical peel procedure depends on the type
                      of chemical used. You may opt for chemical peeling if you

                      Hydrafacial is a "hydradermabrasion" treatment that
                      basically involves three steps â€” cleansing, exfoliating,
                      and then infusing skin with essential serums. Hydra Facial
                      is a procedure that can give you a refreshed, hydrated and
                      energised skin in just 30 minutes. As it is a dermabrasion
                      treatment, so a controlled exfoliation of dead cells is
                      carried out, the pores are deep cleansed and then infused
                      with hydrating and moisturising serums.

                    <p>
                      The treatment is relaxing, rejuvenating, non-irritating
                      giving immediate results. It promotes long-term skin

                      Also known as charcoal facial, charcoal peel or carbon
                      peel, it is a very gentle non-invasive laser procedure
                      with zero down time using activated charcoal to improve
                      the radiance of the skin. The carbon is virtually blasted
                      off the skin from the perfectly fired laser. Dead skin
                      cells, makeup residue, clogged pores, oil and blackheads
                      are removed, leaving the skin radiant and glowing.

                      Skin tag is extra growth of skin tissue, hanging off the
                      skin as a flap with a connecting stalk. They are most
                      commonly present in the folds of the body like the neck,
                      armpits ETC They may also be found on back and chest. Skin
                      tags are more common in females than males, elderly
                      people, and people with high body mass index.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Skin tags are usually asymptomatic. However, they can
                      become irritated if anything, such as clothing, jewellery,
                      or skin rubs against them. Skin tag removal is a single
                      session procedure, however, if a person has multiple skin
                      tags, they may be removed in more than one sitting.

                      Laser hair removal in delhi is a pain-free cosmetic
                      procedure through exposure to pulses of laser light that
                      destroy the hair follicles. Anyone with unwanted dark
                      coarse hair is a good candidate for laser hair removal
                      treatment to get rid of unwanted hair. Hair removal works
                      in all skin types and skin tones.

                    <p>
                      Females with increased facial hair growth and underlying
                      hormonal imbalances can also undergo laser hair removal
                      and the treatment of hormonal issues after consulting and
                      obtaining medical advice from the Dermatologist.

                      Anyone facing problems with ingrown hairs and folliculitis
                      is a good candidate for permanent hair removal. People
                      with white or grey hair do not have sufficient melanin in
                      the hair roots to serve as targets for laser light. Hence
                      they are not suitable candidates and must consider other
                      hair removal options.
