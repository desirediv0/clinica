        <section className="mb-6">
            <p>
                This is a form of tourism in which dental tourism is clubbed with tours and several medical travel agencies provide specialized services in this regard. Dental treatment is not expensive when compared with other countries for its quality. The dental tour operators have a tie up with highly qualified dentists. They help get in touch with your dentist and also arrange a nice customizable package tour wherein you can visit your favorite cities and places in India. Many a times, a dentist customizes a treatment plan which fits into your travel itinerary. This treatment plan is customized keeping in mind patients&#39; needs and also the treatments which have no downtime are placed in your itinerary, like dental fillings, gums treatments, teeth whitening, teeth cleanings, veneers. These treatments are fast and don&#39;t need any major changes in your itinerary.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Medical Tourism Visa, Accommodation & Assistance</h2>
            <p>
                <span className="font-bold">Visa:</span> Getting visa to travel to India for dental treatment has become a lot simpler than what it was earlier. Now, you no longer need to visit an embassy or send off your passport – the Indian Government has introduced online tourist Visa (e-Visa) for business, tourism, or medical visits. Citizens from 150+ countries, including the US, who are travelling to India for periods less than 60 days can now seamlessly apply online for an Indian Tourist Visa. The process is really simple and does not take much time to complete. In addition, there is visa on arrival for 180 countries. So you can just book a flight and get the visa when you reach India. Although, it would be advisable to obtain e-Visa if you want to avoid the lines!!
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="font-bold">E-Visa Request Process:</span> You can apply for the e-Visa online and, once approved, the visa is sent to you via email. When applying for an e-Visa, it is not necessary to submit your passport or other personal documents to the consulate. The e-Visa approval will be issued in advance electronically before your departure to India. Tourists wishing to visit India will normally be granted Tourist Visa, effective from the date of issue. Tourist Visa is non-extendible.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="font-bold">Medical Tourism Visa In India:</span> The Government of India provides a specialized medical tourist visa to India for foreigners who seek medical treatment in India. The stay time for a person with medical tourist visa in India is determined by the time taken for the procedure as well as the recovery time. Typically, the Government of India grants a one year period for a medical tourist visa (depending upon the type of treatment). However, this can be extended with the approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="font-bold">What You Need To Obtain A Medical Tourist Visa In India:</span>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                    <li>Medical documents, images, & prescriptions for verification by Indian Missions & Posts</li>
                    <li>Details of medical/procedural plans with advice of doctors in their country and doctors opted for in India</li>
                    <li>Passport with a validity of at least six months (with photocopy of passport) for patient and attendant (if any)</li>
                    <li>Proof of relation of attendant with patient</li>
                    <li>Proof of residential address</li>
                    <li>Photocopy of online visa application form</li>
                    <li>Proof of required funds for medical procedures and period of stay</li>
                </ul>
                After providing these relevant documents, the procedure for obtaining a medical tourism visa to India is similar to the tourist visa. However, the cost of medical tourism visa depends upon the country of origin. For further assistance, contact our international patient Customer care here: <br />

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">World Class Dental Treatment at a Much Lower Price Than Your Home Country</h2>
            <p>
                At <span className="font-bold">CLINICA DENTAL AND SKIN</span>, we claim to do world class dental treatment, as we only use proven established materials from internationally recognised companies. This is testified by the video testimonials of myriad patients from across the globe who have visited us and thus have become an integral part of Dental Tourism in Delhi. Our international patients feel secure about the fact that when they walk into a dental clinic in their native country or any other country the materials which were used in their dental work here at <span className="font-bold">CLINICA DENTAL AND SKIN</span> will be recognised by the dentists there. This factor has helped in the substantial increase in the traffic for Dental Tourism in India. Some examples of the materials we use are:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>Fillings – Composite teeth coloured fillings from 3M (USA) and Ivoclar(Germany)</li>
                <li>Teeth Whitening – Zoom Whitespeed (USA)</li>
                <li>Veneers – e max porcelain veneers from Ivoclar (Germany)</li>
                <li>Implants – Straumann (USA), Nobel Active Biocare (Sweden)</li>
                <li>Crowns and Bridges – Dentsply (USA) Cercon HT high strength</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our Dental equipment is imported from the USA and Europe, therefore assuring you of world class dental treatment.
            </p>
            <p className="font-bold">Some of the equipment we use are:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>RVG (Radiovisiography) machine for instant digital images of teeth with zero scattered radiation replacing the traditional imaging techniques of xrays is from the Satelec company of France</li>
                <li>The light cure unit is from Ivoclar company in Germany</li>
                <li>The ultrasonic scalers are from Satelec Company in France</li>
                <li>Our rotary files and reamers for the one sitting root canal treatments, using motorised technique is from Dentsply Company in USA</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The global standard equipment from international companies ensuring world class treatment is another big factor contributing to the Dental Tourism in India favourably. Our treatments are available at a fraction of the cost you would pay in your home country.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="font-bold">For Example:</span><br />
                A simple white filling, which may cost you approximately 400 Euros in Europe, can be done for around 30 Euros at our clinic.<br />
                A root canal treatment, which costs approximately US$3000 in Europe or America, will cost you just US $90-100 at our clinic.
            </p>
            <p>
                The substantially cost effective rates of dental treatments in Delhi using the same international quality of materials and equipment which are used in the first world countries is one of the top reasons for not just a steady increase of Dental Tourism in Delhi also Dental Tourism In India.
